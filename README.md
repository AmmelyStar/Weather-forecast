Weather App

This is a simple weather application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for any city. Users can enter the name of a city, and the app will display the current temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed. The app fetches weather data from the SheCodes Weather API and uses Axios for making HTTP requests. It also features a clean and responsive design, making it easy to use on both desktop and mobile devices.
